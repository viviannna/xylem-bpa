        <h1>Promote Solar Energy</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Provide Rebates or Require Solar Energy on New Builds</h2>
        <br>

Sometimes, panesl can even produce more electricity than needed, resulting in a rebate from the electric company. They can provide a source of electricty for up to 30 years and are relatively low maintenance. All of this is possible while reducing your building's reliance on fossil fuels and oil.</p>

        <p>It's no question that plastic is bad for the environment. It takes many years to decompose and it releases many toxic chemicals into the airstream as it does so. Implementing policies such as plastic bans that promote the usage of paper or reusable bags instead can gretly reduce your community's impact. </p>
