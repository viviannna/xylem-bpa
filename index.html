                <br>
                <p>Environmentalism is more than this weekâ€™s trending topic. Studies have shown that communities with greener practices have better air and water quality, education, and public area safety. The collective of small individual steps, taken by all citizens, to reduce our carbon footprint not only impacts the world as a whole but streets directly outside of your door.
