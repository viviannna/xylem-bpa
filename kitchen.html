        <h1>Learn More About What You Can Do</h1><br>
        <h2>Adjust your Diet</h2><br>
        <p>Meat, cheese, and eggs have the highest carbon footprint. By shifting to a vegetarian or even vegan diet, households could potentially reduce their carbon output by as much as 25%. Find out more about the carbon emissions of certain foods <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualising-the-greenhouse-gas-impact-of-each-food/" target="blank">here</a>.</p><br><br>

        <h2>Save Water</h2><br>
        <p>By adjusting how often or how efficiently you use the dishwasher, re-utilizing your kitchen water in your garden, or by simply watching how often you use water in your everday life and choosing to strategize in order to reduce usage, you can contribute to the efforts in your community to reduce carbon emission.</p><br><br>
        <p> If you choose to go vegetarian, you could reduce up to 50% of the water that you use, as a meat-based diet requires more than two times the amount of water needed for a plant-based diet. Adjusting your diet has one of the largest effects on your carbon footprint.</p><br><br>
        
        <h2>Grow your Own Food</h2><br>
        <p>Aside from being able to monitor what goes into your body and ensuring that it's pesticide-free, growing your own food also helps create more localized produce, encouraging less transportation costs and other logistical causes of carbon emission that come with importing groceries from other areas. </p><br><br>
